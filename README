This is my personal Html menu for GVim. I started to write it for 6.x release and updated it everytime I needed ;)
It includes :

* a "new blank Html" feature, 
* all Heading tags, 
* formatting text with tags most used (not all...) and font/color tags, 
* function to insert Tables, List Item, special chars
* option to indent source page 

and more...
